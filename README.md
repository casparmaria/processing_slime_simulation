# Processing: A particle simulation

This little program was written during a project period where the Java-based Processing language was introduced to us. Insprired by Sebastian Lague (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A), I tried to understand and convert the concepts to Processing.

## Installation

Open header folder ```./particle_sensing/``` in Processing and install additional PostFX library from marketplace which is used to blurr the screen.

## Usage

Feel free to make changes to the constant variables in the code. These determine the look and feel of the simulation as well as other factors such as whether the sensors of every particle should be shown or not.
